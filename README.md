# MESM
The MESM system intended for the Raspberry pi zero.    MESM stands for Mobile Environmental Sensor Module.    Using the DH11 humidity/temperature sensor, and future sensing abilities, the    unit is meant to be worn on a backpack, etc while hiking and will measure atmospheric conditions and record the data using Python.
